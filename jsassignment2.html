    <h1>The similarities between const, var, and let. These are all keywords in JavaScript that are used to declare variables. They are used to store data values that can be used throughout  The differences between const, var, and let. </h1>

<P>- const: This keyword is used to declare a variable that cannot be reassigned a new value once it has been initialized. For example, if you declare a variable using const, you cannot change its value later in your code. </P>

Example: </P>

const pi = 3.14;</P>
pi = 3.14159; // This will throw an error because pi is a constant and cannot be reassigned.</P>


- var: This keyword is used to declare a variable that can be reassigned a new value at any point in your code. However, it has a global scope, which means that it can be accessed from anywhere in your code. </P>

Example: </P>

var x = 5;</P>
function myFunction() {</P>
  var x = 10;</P>
  console.log(x); // Output: 10</P>
}</P>
console.log(x); // Output: 5</P>


- let: This keyword is used to declare a variable that can be reassigned a new value, but it has a block scope, which means that it can only be accessed within the block of code where it was declared. </P>

Example: </P>

let x = 5;</P>
if (true) {</P>
  let x = 10;</P>
  console.log(x); // Output: 10</P>
}</P>
console.log(x); // Output: 5</P>


Now, let's talk about the keyword "JavaScript". JavaScript is a programming language that is used to create interactive web pages. It is used to add functionality to websites, such as form validation, animations, and dynamic content. </P>

The keyword "keywords". Keywords are reserved words in a programming language that have a specific meaning and cannot be used as variable names or function names. In JavaScript, some examples of keywords include if, else, while, for, and function.</P>
